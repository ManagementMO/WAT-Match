When you're not working on your project, you will have plenty of time to use our office amenities, physical and virtual educational resources, attend guest speakers and social events, and engage with the parts of our work that excite you the most.\nIf you've never thought about a career in finance, you're in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative spirit, and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you'll fit right in.\nLearn more about Jane Street's\ninternship program\nhere.",

Our mix of in-house and open source software allows us to investigate and innovate at every level.\nDuring the program you'll work on up to two projects, mentored closely by the full-time employees who designed them. Some projects consider big-picture questions that we're still trying to figure out, while others involve building something new. We will choose your projects so you'll gain a better understanding of the wide range of problems we solve every day - from finding new and interesting ways to resolve production issues quickly, performing comprehensive root-cause analyses, and integrating long-term fixes in a clean and robust way.\nWe automate as much of our work as we can, because we find that automation reduces our error rate and overall workload - plus, we think it's fun. You'll have a unique opportunity to see how our team interacts with almost every other group, both reacting in real time when things go wrong and building future-looking solutions that work on a firm-wide scale.

We apply these same principles to our FPGA Engineering work, and we're looking for people who are interested in using programming language technology to improve the process of designing, testing, and validating hardware designs. We use Hardcaml, an OCaml library for succinctly describing hardware in RTL. Hardcaml is tightly integrated into our development environment, so you'll also gain lots of exposure to the libraries and tools that are foundational to our internal systems. No previous knowledge of Hardcaml is required.\nDuring the program, you'll dive deep on one project, mentored closely by the full-time employees who helped design it. Some intern projects consider big-picture questions that we're still trying to figure out, while others involve building something new. Your mentors will help you gain a better understanding of the wide range of problems we solve every day. We expect interns to build FPGA applications from concept to a working design; your projects will predominantly involve OCaml & Hardcaml, for both RTL design and testing/integration.\nIf you'd like to learn more, you can read about\nour interview process\n,\nmeet some of our newest hires\n, or check out our\nOCaml All The Way Down talk\nand\nProgrammable Hardware podcast\nepisode.",
